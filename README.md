# Faraso (Farasoo) API Library

An implemented library for sending domain operation requests to Faraso (فراسو) web service.

For a long time I was looking for a free version of this type of library, Finally I have implemented it using WSDL page of company.

This version only includes the _register_ and _renew_ methods. According to WSDL there are more operations like _transfer_ domain.

**Note:** This project only works with _username_ and _password_ for authorizing in web service. (faraso.org)
